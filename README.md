# TwoPeopleTicTacToe
## Summary
Simple two people tic-tax-toe written using Java and JavaFX. This version supports the following:
- reset, undo and redo
- game end detection

## Setup
The Java files are under ```src/game```. The main application is in Main.java. 

Additionally, the IntelliJ project files are in the ```.idea``` directory for reference.

Since the project uses JavaFx, it needs to be downloaded from [https://openjfx.io/](https://openjfx.io/) and extracted on the host computer. When setting up a new IntelliJ project with the Java files found under ```src/game```, follow the [Getting Started with JavaFX 11](https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/#IDE-Intellij) instructions to make sure the IntelliJ project is set up properly.
